#### **Annoucements**
<span style="color:red;">We extend the solution submission deadline to Nov 14th!</span>


Financial reinforcement learning (FinRL), as an interdisciplinary field of finance and reinforcement learning, has been recognized as a promising approach to financial tasks. Over the past decade, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in solving complex problems across a variety of domains, including robotics, gaming, and large language models like ChatGPT and GPT-4. The success of DRL has also led to its application in finance, where it has demonstrated great potential for enhancing the performance of financial tasks, such as portfolio management, option pricing, and algorithmic trading.

The FinRL contest is a competition that explores and evaluates the capability of machine learning methods in finance. However, developing machine learning algorithms for financial data presents unique challenges:

1. **Dynamic Transitions and Data Noise:** Financial datasets are constantly evolving, making it difficult to capture the underlying dynamics. Moreover, financial data is often susceptible to noise and anomalies. 
2. **Partial Observability:** No traders can access complete market-influencing information due to the gigantic, complex, and unpredictable nature of financial systems, where unforeseen events like natural disasters, policy changes, and consumer behavior shifts can have hard-to-anticipate effects.
3. **Other Complex Behaviors:** Many other factors can cause complicated and unpredictable behaviors, such as the market’s decentralized nature and the large number of financial instruments available.

The FinRL Contest presents two tasks, data-centric stock trading and real time order execution, aiming to foster innovations toward addressing the above challenges. We welcome students, researchers, and engineers who are passionate about finance and machine learning. And we encourage the development of tailored data processing strategies, novel features, and innovative algorithms that can adapt to changing market conditions and generate superior returns for investors.

## Data
We have more than 30 market data sources to deal with different financial tasks. We hold the data APIs and sample market environments in an open-source repository, FinRL-Meta, as shown in Figure 1. Contestants are welcome to explore and use in the FinRL Contest.

Figure 1: Market data sources of FinRL-Meta

## Environment
With a deep reinforcement learning approach, market datasets are processed into gym-style market environments. Table 1 lists the state spaces, action spaces, and reward functions of
different FinRL applications. A state shows how an agent perceives a market situation. Facing a state, the agent can take an action from the action set, which may vary according to the financial tasks. Reward is an incentive mechanism for an agent to learn a better policy. Contestants will specify the state space, action space, and reward functions in the environment for Task I Data-Centric Stock Trading.

Winners will be invited to attend the ACM ICAIF 2023 conference and have the opportunity to present their work at the conference.

## Tasks

Each team can choose to participate in one or both tasks. The prizes will be awarded for each task.


### Starter Kit
The starter kit and related resources will be available at [Github](https://github.com/Open-Finance-Lab/FinRL_Contest_2023).

### Task I: Data-Centric Stock Trading
This task emphasizes data engineering in building FinRL agents. The contestants are encouraged to devise novel data-centric strategies to clean, transform, and aggregate stock data to improve trading performance, with the model being fixed.

A dataset containing OHLCV data for stocks is provided. Contestants are free to design data processing strategies and perform feature engineering, such as constructing new indicators based on existing and/or external market data. Then the contestants are required to:

1. Specify the state space, action space, and reward functions in the environment.
2. Ensure that your data pipeline is reproducible with unseen, new data.
3. Use the same model design without modification for a fair comparison. Specifically, teams are asked to use the PPO algorithm in the FinRL library with tunable hyperparameters.

Each team should also submit a 1-2 page report with the [ACM sigconf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-primary-article-template/wbvnghjbzwpc) through [Open Review](https://openreview.net/group?id=ACM.org/ICAIF/2023/FinRL_Contest). The title should start with “FinRL Contest Task I.”

#### Evaluation
**Quantitative assessment** is the geometric mean of the following metrics:

1. Portfolio cumulative return. It measures the excess returns.
2. Sharpe ratio. It takes into account both the returns of the portfolio and the level of risk.
3. Max drawdown. It is the portfolio’s largest percentage drop from a peak to a trough in a certain time period, which provides a measure of downside risk.

**Qualitative assessment** of the report:

The assessment of the reports will be conducted by invited experts and professionals. The judges will independently rate the data and model analysis, results and discussion, robustness and generalizability, innovation and creativity, organization and readability, each accounting for 20% of the qualitative assessment. 

The final ranking will be determined by the combination of 60% quantitative and 40% qualitative assessment.

### Task II: Real Time Order Execution
This task focuses on building lightweight algorithmic trading systems in a fair environment.

A template will be provided for contestants, and each team needs to write their functions in this template to perform order execution. We will provide an exchange of limit order book data to interact with contestants. After the contest, we will conduct real-time trading for all teams' submissions at the same time. We would advise you to keep your algorithms lightweight. 

Each team should also submit a 1-2 page report with the [ACM sigconf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-primary-article-template/wbvnghjbzwpc) through [Open Review](https://openreview.net/group?id=ACM.org/ICAIF/2023/FinRL_Contest). The title should start with “FinRL Contest Task II.”


#### Evaluation
**Quantitative assessment** is pure PnL. Strategies that fail to adhere to the template will be disqualified, as well as any strategies that fail to pass linting.

**Qualitative assessment** of the report is the same as Task I:

The assessment of the reports will be conducted by invited experts and professionals. The judges will independently rate the data and model analysis, results and discussion, robustness and generalizability, innovation and creativity, organization and readability, each accounting for 20% of the qualitative assessment.

The final ranking will be determined by the combination of 60% quantitative and 40% qualitative assessment.
