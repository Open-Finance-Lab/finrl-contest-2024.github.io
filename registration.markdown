To participate in the ICAIF 2023 Conference, each team can complete [ICAIF-23 registration](https://ai-finance.org/icaif-23-registration/). Teams should choose "In-Person" or "Virtual" according to their situations.

Team registration is done through the [website](https://finrl-contest-2023.web.app/). Please ensure that all team members provide their full names, emails, institutions, the team name, and the ICAIF registration number (optional). We encourage you to use your institutional email to register.

## Submission
All submissions are to be submitted through the website as well. Participants may choose to complete either or both tracks of the competition with no penalty. Note that the most recent submission that passes linting for each track will be the one used in final evaluations.
